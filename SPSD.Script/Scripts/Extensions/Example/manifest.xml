            <Description>
                This is an example to show how the SPSD extensions system is working.              
                  
                This manifest file defines 
                  - the extension type, 
                  - the version 
                  - the associated script file and 
                  - if the extension is currently enabled or disabled entirely    
                  
                 By specifying this, it allows SPSD to automatically pick up your extension and register it for deployment actions.
                 The extension is loaded in-line, which means that functions and variables of the extension script are not available
                 after the extension is done.
                 
                 Please have a look into the comments in the other example extensions files to understand how each of it works.
